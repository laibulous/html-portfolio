<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Peace & Greetings!<br>
  <br>
  I'm Laiba Nadeem, a passionate web developer currently in my 5th semester as a Software Engineering student at FAST NUCES. My journey into web development began with Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course, and I've been built some really cool HTML projects ever since.
  <p>While web dev is my current focus, I bring a strong foundation in C++ to the table. I'm well-versed in the fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data structures.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond the technical aspects, I'm a huge tech enthusiast who thrives on continuous learning and growth. This website is a testament to that â€“ a platform to showcase my skills and document my development journey.</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!</p>
